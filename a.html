<p>The plot of Attack on Titan centers on a civilization inside three walls. According to the knowledge propagated locally, it is the last location where humans still live. It's inhabitants have been led to believe that over one hundred years ago, humanity was driven to the brink of extinction after the emergence of humanoid giants called Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight. The last remnants of humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed nearly a century of peace and the thought of venturing outside is frowned upon and discouraged. To combat Titans, the country's military employs Vertical Maneuvering Equipment, a set of waist-mounted grappling hooks and gas-powered propulsion enabling immense mobility in three dimensions.</p>

</ul>
</nav>
<p>Eren Yeager is a boy who lives in the town of Shiganshina, located on the outermost of three circular walls protecting the inhabitants of Paradis island from Titans. In the year 845, the first wall is breached by two new types of Titans, the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan. During the incident, Eren's mother is eaten by a Titan while Eren escapes. He swears revenge on all Titans and enlists in the military along with his childhood friends, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert. He intends to join the Survey Corps, the expeditionary force that seeks to eradicate the Titans.
</p>
<p>Five years after Shiganshina's fall, Trost a town of the second wall is attacked once more by the Colossal Titan. Eren learns that he has the mysterious ability to turn himself into a sentient Attack Titan. This draws the attention of the Survey Corps, who intends to use his power to reclaim Wall Maria. The Military Police and government all hope at taking ownership over Eren and using his powers for their good. Eren is handed over to Captain Levi and Hange Zoe of the Special Operations Squad, where they test his limits and loyalty. Eren realizes that he has to give himself pain if he is to use his Titan form properly. Survey Corps commander Erwin Smith leads their troops into an expedition into the forest between the walls, where they encounter a sentient Female Titan. Levi's squad is killed in the battle, and Eren fails to use his Titan form properly in his rage. After distancing themselves from the Military Police's corruption, Eren and his companions deduce that their fellow military reg Annie Leonhart is the Female Titan. Eren and Annie fight, killing many townsfolk before Annie crystallizes herself. Eren is jailed, being deemed too unstable but Levi and Erwin secure his protection.
</p>
<p>Titans mysteriously appear within the walls with no evidence of how they got in. The Survey Corps is sent to investigate, but one of their top squad leaders is killed when he encounters the sentient Beast Titan, an ape-like titan who can speak. Ymir, one of the new Survey Corps graduates, reveals that she can transform into a Titan after being exiled from a distant land. Christa Lenz tells them that her true name is Historia Reiss and that she is a member of the island's royal bloodline. Reiner Braun and Bertholt Hoover betray their team by transforming into the Armored Titan and Colossal Titan after they are unable to convince Eren to return to their homeland with them. They proceed to take Eren hostage. Erwin leads a successful charge to rescue Eren, wherein Eren uses a mysterious power called 'the coordinate' to control Titans; Reiner, Bertholt, and Ymir escape to their homeland Marley across the ocean. The Titans are revealed to be transformed humans from Ragako Village, which included graduate Connie Springer's family.
</p>
<p>Eren and his friends join Levi Squad while the Survey Corps is targeted by the Military Police. Levi Squad and Hange are pursued by corrupt police led by Levi's uncle, Kenny Ackerman. They discover that by transforming into a Pure Titan and eating another Titan shifter, a person can gain its abilities. The island's ruler, King Fritz, is shown to be a puppet controlled by government officials. Historia and her father, Rod Reiss, are the only surviving members of the royal bloodline. Reiss takes Eren hostage because Eren is in possession of the Founding Titan after his father Grisha ate Frieda Reiss, the Titan's previous owner. Reiss transforms into a monstrous Pure Titan and heads to Orvud District; Historia kills her father, declaring herself Queen. The combined powers of the Beast, Colossal, and Armored lead to much of the Survey Corps being killed in the ensuing war; Armin gains ownership of the Colossal Titan by eating Bertolt, and Erwin dies in a suicide run against the Beast Titan. Eren and his companions return to his home, where they discover the truth of their world: they are actually Eldians, sworn enemies of the conquering Marleyans who were enclosed within the walls after King Fritz fled from the war. They are not the last humans as they were told, but rather an enclosed sect of Eldians on an isolated island called Paradis. Because they are 'Subjects of Ymir' who can be turned into Titans by being injected with spinal fluid, the Eldians continue to be oppressed by Marley. The Survey Corps kill all the remaining Titans in the walls.
</p>
<p>Three years later, Marley struggles to keep their dominance when other nations invent anti-Titan weaponry. Warriors-in-training Gabi Braun and Falco Grice are thrown into the war when the Survey Corps attack Marley's capital, Liberio. Eren kills Willy Tybur, who had been controlling Marley from the shadows and gains ownership of the Warhammer Titan after eating its previous owner, Tybur's sister. Armin's Colossal Titan transforms, destroying their naval fleet and preventing an immediate counterattack. They escape and head back to Paradis after their victory, though Gabi and Falco board the airship and kill Sasha. It's revealed that followers of Eren's half-brother Zeke, owner of the Beast Titan, led by Yelena were working with Paradis to plan the attack; Zeke claims to be a true Eldian restorationist. Eren is imprisoned for treachery against the Survey Corps, but escapes along with a faction of extremist Paradis followers called the Yeagerists. In doing so, Eren betrays his friends and loses Armin and Mikasa's trust, though Eren declares his immense hatred and distaste for the two. Yelena and her followers take control over Paradis' government, attempting to reunite Eren with Zeke, who is being held by Levi. Zeke escape's Levi, severely injuring him, and his true plan is revealed to be to use Eren's Founding Titan to stop the Subjects of Ymir from reproducing. Marley's air fleet arrives, led by Reiner, and war breaks out. Eren is seemingly killed when Gabi shoots and decapitates him.
</p>
<p>Eren survives and meets Zeke in the Paths, an interconnecting series of gateways connecting all Subjects of Ymir through time and space. He also meets the consciousness of Ymir Fritz, the original Titan, whose tortured past has led to her imprisonment within the Paths for thousands of years. Zeke takes control of the Founding Titan and reveals his intent to convert Eren to his ideology. However, Eren is able to manipulate the past using his Attack Titan and convince Grisha in the past to kill the Reiss family. Eren convinces Ymir to use her power to unleash the Rumbling, unshackling thousands of Colossal Titans kept within Paradis' walls and leading them on a genocidal march of killing everyone outside of the walls. The Survey Corps ally with remaining Marley forces, including Reiner and a now-freed Annie, battling the Paradis military to board an aircraft in order to stop 'The Rumbling'. Upon reaching Eren, Armin convinces a nihilistic Zeke that life has meaning beyond multiplication, after which Levi beheads Zeke and stops the Rumbling. An unknown organism that granted Ymir the power of the titans alongside Eren bring the Survey Corps and their allies to the brink of defeat, but Mikasa manages to kill Eren while having a vision of an alternate world where she ran away with Eren. Armin recalls when Eren visited him in the Paths, where Eren revealed that he became humanity's enemy to follow a vision of the future he had. Eren also reveals that Mikasa killing him made the power of the Titans, including Ymir, vanish. Three years later, Levi lives retired in another country with Gabi and Falco while the island's inhabitants build their military in preparation for potential future retaliation from the world, but Armin and his allies, the surviving Survey Corps and Warriors, have hope that peace negotiations led by Queen Historia will be successful. Mikasa buries Eren underneath a tree on a hill near Shiganshina District. An unknown amount of time after Mikasa's death, an advanced Shiganshina District is bombed from above by an unknown nation and is destroyed. When the ruins have been overtaken by a forest, a boy who survived the war approaches the same tree Eren was buried under; which has continued to grow and now resembles the tree where the organism that granted Ymir her Titan power lived.
