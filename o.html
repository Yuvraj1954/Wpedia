<p>One-Punch Man (Japanese: ワンパンマン, Hepburn: Wanpanman) is a Japanese superhero franchise created by the artist ONE. It tells the story of Saitama, a superhero who can defeat any opponent with a single punch but seeks to find a worthy opponent after growing bored by a lack of challenge due to his overwhelming strength. ONE wrote the original webcomic version in early 2009.</p>
<p>A digital manga remake began publication on Shueisha's Tonari no Young Jump website in June 2012. The manga is illustrated by Yusuke Murata, and its chapters are periodically compiled and published into individual tankōbon volumes. As of December 2021, 24 volumes have been released. In North America, Viz Media has licensed the remake manga for English language release and was serialized in its Weekly Shonen Jump digital magazine.</p>

<p><When ONE returned to drawing in 2011, he was contacted by artist Yusuke Murata about a possible partnership in which Murata would redraw the webcomic for ONE. Murata had been an enormous fan of One-Punch Man and was ill at the time.[12] Fearing he was going to die, he contacted ONE. Looking back, he said, "Around that time, I was actually really sick. I broke out in hives, my inner organs were infected, and I couldn't breathe well with my windpipes [sic] swelling. I was in the hospital when I thought, 'Ah, I guess people die just like that.' If I'm going to die, I want to do something I really love to do. I want to draw manga with Mr. ONE. That's what I thought."[12] Murata, already a successful manga artist, used his connections in the industry to get a publishing deal with Weekly Young Jump comics.[12] The manga became a digital publication on Weekly Young Jump's spin-off manga website Tonari no Young Jump (となりのヤングジャンプ, Tonari no Yangu Janpu), published by Shueisha./p>

<p>On a supercontinent Earth, powerful monsters and villains wreak havoc in the cities. In response, the millionaire Agoni creates the Hero Association, which employs superheroes to fight evil. Saitama, an unassociated hero, hails from City Z and performs heroic deeds as a hobby. He has trained himself to the point of being able to defeat any enemy with a single punch, but his unmatched strength has left him with an overwhelming sense of boredom. Saitama becomes a reluctant mentor to Genos, a cyborg seeking revenge against another cyborg who killed his family and destroyed his hometown, after saving him from a monster. Saitama and Genos join the Hero Association in hopes of attaining notability, but due to scoring low on the written entry exam, Saitama is placed at a low-entry rank, and his feats remain unnoticed by the public despite saving people from two colossal disasters even after registration.</p>
<p>When the Hero Association calls all the top heroes to a meeting because the seer Shibabawa predicted the world was in danger before dying, an alien named Boros invades the planet. The heroes kill the alien forces and destroy Boros's ship; Saitama slays him in single combat, with him notoriously taking multiple punches to kill. In the aftermath, Saitama meets heroes like the martial artist Bang, the esper Blizzard, and the sham hero King. Monsters begin appearing at a growing rate while the rogue martial artist Garo, Bang's former apprentice and self-dubbed "Hero Hunter," begins terrorizing heroes due to holding a grudge against everything "heroic" from childhood bullying.</p>
<p>The monster influx is revealed to be the doing of the Monster Association, an organization composed of monsters intent on destroying the Hero Association located under City Z. They attack various cities, kidnap a Hero Association executive's child, and recruit fighters by offering them "monster cells" that cause humans to mutate into monsters with extraordinary abilities when eaten. Garo bonds with a child who idolizes heroes as he hunts down more and more heroes, his combat prowess slowly rising. The Monster Association attempts to recruit him and kidnaps the child when Garo refuses, leading him to storm the Monster Association headquarters trying to rescue the child, ultimately being captured. The Hero Association assaults the headquarters to rescue the captive children and a chaotic battle ensues, destroying City Z. Almost every monster is slain in battle, with Blizzard capturing Psykos, her childhood friend and the mastermind of the organization. Saitama meets the extremely powerful hero Blast during the raid when he arrives to collect artifacts, who warns him of a threat only known as "God." Many of the heroes are heavily injured when Garo emerges, having mutated into an immensely powerful monster. He effortlessly defeats the remaining heroes when Saitama arrives and confronts him, managing to destroy his monster mutation and revert him to a human after a brutal battle. Despite the objections of the other heroes, Saitama spares Garo and lets him flee after his befriended child stops them.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the battle, the Hero Association's poor performance leads to public opinion of them plummeting. Several heroes and officials decide to retire or defect to the Neo Heroes, a burgeoning rival group that appears to be more effective in handling the growing monster threats with its larger membership and the leadership of the hero Blue, who claims to be the son of the Blast.</p>
